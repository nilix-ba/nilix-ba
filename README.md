# Hi, I’m Niloufar 👋🌿

I’m a Master’s student in **Intelligent Adaptive Systems** at the **University of Hamburg** who enjoys building things where **language + search + ML** collide. If it involves **NLP**, **RAG**, or poking at models until they behave, I’m probably into it.

---

## 🧠 What I’m into right now
- **RAG systems** (retrieval, chunking, reranking, evaluation… the whole zoo)
- **Information retrieval** and “why didn’t it find the thing I *clearly* meant?”
- **Few-/zero-shot learning**
- **Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)** (yes, it’s as tricky as it sounds)
- Making prototypes that go from *idea → running system* without too many tears T.T

---

## 🛠️ Things I keep  in my toolbox
**Languages:** Python, C/C++, R, SQL  
**Tools & stuff:** pandas, NumPy, Git, Docker, LaTeX  
**Also:** PostgreSQL, Chroma, and LLaMA-ish interfaces when I’m feeling brave

---

## 🧪 A few things I’ve done
- Built and deployed a **full RAG system** for exploring a tool catalog  
  (web scraping → PostgreSQL → vector DB → LLaMA interface… it was a journey ✨)
- Researched **WSD in few-/zero-shot settings**, comparing **prompt-tuning vs fine-tuning**
- Visited **KU Leuven** and worked on **Automatic Speech Recognition calibration**, including an **MLP post-processor**

---

## 🧑‍🏫 Teaching & helping humans
I’ve been a **Teaching Assistant** (Fundamentals of CS & Programming, Advanced IR), and also a **welcome buddy** in Hamburg—helping international students settle in academically and culturally. (Pro tip: the first weeks are always a mini-adventure.)

---

## 🌍 Languages
- Persian (native)
- English (C1 / IELTS)
- German (A2 — language model in training; loss is decreasing… slowly 😄)

If you’re working on NLP/IR/RAG stuff, feel free to reach out — I love swapping ideas (and debugging stories).
